# tdldot
ToDo List Data Organize Tool.
## Introduction
There are already many **To-Do lists** in the world, and I think that more than email providers or health management devices, different people use different ones.

> Most people probably use Apple Reminder, Todoist, or TickTick. 

However, app developers need to meet the integration needs of each to-do list, and doing so individually is extremely difficult. **tdldot** is an API platform that consolidates the APIs of multiple todo lists and can support multiple todo list apps simply by implementing the **tdldot API**.
## Integration
- Todoist
- Google Task (plan)
- TickTick (plan)
- Microsoft To Do (plan)
- Apple Reminder (plan)
